## Why CSS Grid?

CSS Grid Layout is a powerful 2-dimensional layout system that revolutionizes how we create web layouts.

## Key Concepts

### Grid Container
The parent element that defines the grid context.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Grid Items
Child elements that are automatically placed within the grid.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Responsive Grids
Use `minmax()` and `auto-fit` for responsive layouts:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
```

### 2. Grid Areas
Define named grid areas for better organization:

```css
grid-template-areas: 
  "header header"
  "sidebar content"
  "footer footer";
```

### 3. Implicit Grids
Let the browser create rows automatically as needed.

## Browser Support

CSS Grid has excellent browser support across all modern browsers. It's safe to use in production today!

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic grids and add complexity gradually
2. **Use Grid for 2D Layouts**: Reserve Flexbox for 1-dimensional layouts
3. **Combine with Flexbox**: Use both tools together for optimal results
4. **Test Across Devices**: Ensure your grid works on all screen sizes

## Conclusion

CSS Grid is an essential tool for modern web developers. Master it, and you'll create better layouts with less code.
